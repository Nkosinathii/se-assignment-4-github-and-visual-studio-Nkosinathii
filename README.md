Branching and Merging in GitHub:
What are branches in GitHub, and why are they important? Describe the process of creating a branch, making changes, and merging it back into the main branch.
Pull Requests and Code Reviews:

Branches in GitHub.
Branches are separate versions of a repository. They let you work on different features or fixes without affecting the main codebase.

Importance;
- Isolation: Keep work separate until it's ready.
- Collaboration: Multiple people can work on different tasks simultaneously.

Process;
1. Create a Branch: (git checkout -b new-branch)
2. Make Changes: Edit files and commit changes: 
- git add .
- git commit -m "Description of changes"
3. Push Branch to GitHub: (git push origin new-branch)
4. Create a Pull Request: Propose your changes for review on GitHub.
5. Code Review: Team reviews changes and discusses improvements.
6. Merge Branch: Once approved, merge the branch into the main branch on GitHub.
This keeps the main branch stable while allowing for development and collaboration.

What is a pull request in GitHub, and how does it facilitate code reviews and collaboration? Outline the steps to create and review a pull request.

Pull Request in GitHub
- A pull request (PR) in GitHub is a way to propose changes to a repository. It allows team members to review, discuss, and potentially merge these changes into the main codebase.

Facilitating Code Reviews and Collaboration
1. Proposal: Contributors propose changes from their branch to be merged into the main branch.
2. Discussion: Team members review the code, ask questions, and provide feedback.
3. Improvement: Suggestions and improvements are made before merging to maintain code quality.
4. Integration: Once approved, changes are merged into the main branch, integrating new features or fixes.

Steps to Create and Review a Pull Request
Creating a Pull Request:
1. Create a Branch: From your local repository, create and make changes on a new branch.
- git checkout -b new-feature
2. Push Branch: Push the branch to GitHub.
- git push origin new-feature
3. Create Pull Request: On GitHub, go to the repository and create a new pull request.
- Select the branch with your changes.
- Write a description of what you've done.

Reviewing a Pull Request:
1. Review Changes: Team members review the diff (difference) in code between branches.
2. Discuss: Leave comments, ask questions, and suggest improvements directly in the PR conversation.
3. Approve or Request Changes: Decide whether the changes are ready to merge or request additional modifications.
4. Merge: Once approved, merge the changes into the main branch directly on GitHub.
This process ensures code quality, encourages collaboration, and allows for structured feedback before integrating changes into the main codebase.

GitHub Actions:
Explain what GitHub Actions are and how they can be used to automate workflows. Provide an example of a simple CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions.
Introduction to Visual Studio:

GitHub Actions
- GitHub Actions automate tasks directly within GitHub repositories. They can build, test, and deploy code, triggered by events like commits, pull requests, or schedules.

Automating Workflows
1. Workflow Files: Defined in .github/workflows/ directory.
2. Workflow Steps: Series of actions, each performing specific tasks.
3. Event Triggers: Actions run on events like pushes or pull requests.

Example: Simple CI/CD Pipeline
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Set up Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v2
      with:
        node-version: '14'

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm install

    - name: Run tests
      run: npm test

    - name: Build and deploy
      run: |
        npm run build
        # Example: Deploy to a server or deploy to GitHub Pages

    - name: Notify success
      run: echo "CI/CD pipeline succeeded!"
